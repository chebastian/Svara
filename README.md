# Svara
A library for querying input from the user using notepad

Inspired by the way git handles commit messages by deafult through the cli and rebasing.

Developed during a gamejam when the need for user input in the form of naming and selecting of levels was introduced in a environment where 
regular user input or windows frameworks were not available
